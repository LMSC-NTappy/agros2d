Key Features
------------

* *hp*-FEM

The *hp*-FEM (higher-order finite element method) is a modern version of the finite element method whitch combines finite elements of variable size (*h*) and polynomial degree (*p*) in order to obtain fast exponential convergence.

* Curvilinear elements
