Electrostatic Planar Capacitor
==============================

This example demonstrates the basics of working with Agros2D. The resulting model can be found */data/electrostatic_planar_capacitor.a2d*.

Introduction
------------

Capacitor is a passive electrical component, which consists of electrodes that are separated by a dielectric and have different electrical potential. It is used to store electric charge. The basic type of the capacitor is a plate capacitor.

Geometry
^^^^^^^^

* Nodes

  Select "Operate on nodes" in the menu "Problem" and place 6 points with coordinates [0.1, 0.0], [0.2, 0.0], [0.0, 0.2], [0.0, 0.3], [0.1, 0.2] and [0.2, 0.3]. You can move mouse to requested place and press left button together with Ctrl key, or by pressing Alt+N and entering the node coordinates.

* Edges

  Select "Operate on edges" in the menu "Problem" and draw 6 edges according to the definition area. Press Ctrl key and select start and end node of the line, or press Alt+E and select these points from a list.

* Labels

  Select "Operate on labels" in menu "Problem" and place block label into an inner area. To place label you can use left mouse button together with Ctrl key or pressing Alt+L and entering the label point coordinates.

Calculation of capacity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select "Volume integrals" in menu "File" and mark area "Dielectric". In panel "Volume integral" find value of "Energy" in group "Electrostatic field".

Capacity of the capacitor can be calculated according to formula

.. math::

    W_e = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} CU^2,

which can be adjusted to

.. math::

    C = \frac{4 \cdot 2 \cdot W_e}{U^2}.

Chart of electric potential
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select "Chart" in menu "Tools". This opens a window for plotting charts. As a starting coordinates enter point [0.1, 0.2] and as ending coordinates point [0.2, 0.3]. Select "X" in "Horizontal axis" and select "Plot".
