Solving Problem
===============

Generating of Initial Mesh
--------------------------

Initial mesh is generating automatically before solving, but you can set parameters of this mesh and also generete it manually. In "Problem properties" dialog you can choose type of mesh elements - triangle elements (default) and quadrilaterals (generating from triangle elements with vaious methods). Further opinions are global number of refinements and polynomial order. To generate mesh select "Mesh area" in the menu "Problem" or press Alt+W.

Basic Procedure for Solving
---------------------------

To solve the formulated problem select "Solve problem" in the menu "Problem" or press Alt+S. During the solving of the problem, a special window is shown which is used for notifications about the solving process and error reporting. If the solution is correct, general information about the solving process is shown on the "Problem" panel.

Tips
----

To solve the problem, you can use the command ``solve()``.
