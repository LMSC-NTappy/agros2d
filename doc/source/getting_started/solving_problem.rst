Solving Problem
===============

Basic Procedure for Solving
---------------------------

To solve the formulated problem select "Solve problem" in the menu "Problem" or press Alt+S. During the solving of the problem, a special window is shown which is used for notifications about the solving process and error reporting. If the solution is correct, general information about the solving process is shown on the "Problem" panel.

Generating of Initial Mesh
--------------------------

Initial mesh for solution is generating automatic before solving, but you can set basic parameters of this mesh. In "Problem properties" dialog you can choose type of mesh elements (default is "Triangle"). Further opinions are "Number of refinements" and "Polynomial order".
