   basic_control     
   processing_results   

First sections deals with the installation of program Agros2D under different platforms. 
Because Agros2D is as an open source project, it is also possible to compile binary version from source files.

The section *Basic control* is dedicated to basic work with the Agros2D user interface, section *Editing geometry* It summarizes basic operations with geometry, 
basic settings of problems (materials, boundary conditions, initial conditions etc.). Section *Solving problem* describes settings of mesh generator and solver.

The section "Postprocessing" deals with displaying of results, plotting charts in selected slices and with the calculation of derived variables.
