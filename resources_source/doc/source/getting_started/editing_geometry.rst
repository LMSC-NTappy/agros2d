Modes of Geometry Editing
-------------------------

When editing geometry it is necessary to switch between the three basic modes.

* Operations on nodes
* Operations on edges
* Operations on labels

To switch between different modes you can use the corresponding items in the toolbar.

Adding Components of Geometry
-----------------------------

Adding nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nodes are basic elements for creating the geometry of the solved problem. You have three options for adding them.

* Enter the coordinates directly

  Select "New node..." in the menu "Problem" (submenu "Add"), or press Alt+N and enter the new node coordinates. It is also possible to choose the item "New node" from the context menu. 

* Use the mouse

  Move mouse to requested place and press Ctrl+left click together.

* Use both previous methods together

  Move mouse to the requested place and press Ctrl+Shift+N. Coordinates of the selected place are automatically placed in the dialog box for entering the nodes coordinates.

Adding edges
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add an edge you must have at least two nodes in the geometry. You can add the edge using one of following methods:

* Use the coordinates of existing nodes

  Select "New edge..." in the menu "Problem" (submenu "Add"), or by pressing Alt+E and selecting start and end nodes coordinates.

* Use the mouse

  Move mouse to the requested start node and press the left-click together with Ctrl key, then move the mouse to the requested end node and press Ctrl+left click again.

Adding labels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Labels are used to define individual areas. To add a label you can use the same methods as for adding nodes, i.e.

* Enter the coordinates directly,

* Use both previous methods together,



Editing Parameters of Existing Components
-----------------------------------------

You can double left click on the requested element (node, edge, and label) for editing its parameters. For example, you can create an arc from a straight edge. Positions of nodes, edges and labels you can changed with mouse and pressed keys Ctrl+Shift.

Tips
----

For easy creation of geometry you can use function snap to grid.  You can also view rules in the workspace. Both options can be found under "View" in the aplication settings.

Some operations can also be found in the context menu accessible by right clicking on the workspace or on the panel "Problem".

You can use the full screen display mode to make the most of the workspace view. To switch between modes use the F11 key or select correct option from the workspace context menu.
