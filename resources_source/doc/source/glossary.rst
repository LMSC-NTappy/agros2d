      Number of refinements indicates the number of refinement solution mesh beside initial mesh.

   Polynomial order
      Polynomial order indicates the order of polynomial, which is interlacing individual elements.

   DOFs
      DOF (Degrees of Freedom) indicates the number of equations with which the problem is solved.
