Agros2D is a multiplatform C++ application for the solution of partial differential equations (PDE) based on the `Hermes <http://hpfem.org/hermes>`_ library, developed by the `hpfem.org <http://hpfem.org>`_ group at the `University of West Bohemia in Pilsen <http://www.zcu.cz>`_. Agros2D is distributed under the `GNU General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt>`_.

**Supported Physical Fields:**

* Electrostatic fields
* Electric current fields
* Magnetic fields (steady state, harmonic and transient analysis)
* High frequency electromagnetic fields – in development
* Temperature fields (steady state and transient analysis)
* Acoustic field (harmonic and transient analysis)
* Linear thermo-elasticity
* Incompressible flow (steady state and transient analysis) – in development
