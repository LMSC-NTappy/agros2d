<h3>Introduction</h3>
Induction heating of cylindrical billets made of various nonmagnetic metals (mostly aluminum) is a widely spread technological process often used for their softening before hot forming. This process is usually realized in two following manners:

<ul>
  <li>heating of an unmovable billet in a system of static, harmonic current-carrying inductors,</li>
  <li>heating of a rotating billet in static magnetic field generated by static, direct current-carrying inductors or permanent magnets.</li>
</ul>

Here, the static magnetic field is generated by appropriately arranged high-parameter permanent magnets. The basic arrangement of the proposed device is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of an 3 kW induction motor driving the aluminum cylindrical billet of diameter 60 mm and an active heating part consisting of a magnetic circuit with fixed NdBFe permanent magnets.

<h3>Mathematical model</h3>
The mathematical model of the problem is represented by  two coupled models that describe the distributions of magnetic and temperature field in the 
system. The distribution of magnetic field may advantageously be described in terms of magnetic vector potential $\textbf{A}$. The corresponding equation reads
$$\mathrm{curl} \left(\mu^{-1} \, (\mathrm{curl}\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B_{\mathrm{r}}})\right) - \sigma \mathbf{v} \times \mathrm{curl} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{0}\,,$$

where \(\mu\) denotes the magnetic permeability, \(\mathbf{B_{\mathrm{r}}}\) is the remanent magnetization, \(\sigma\) stands for the electric conductivity and v represents the vector of the local velocity of rotation (nonzero only in the rotating billet). The Dirichlet condition \(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{0}\) is prescribed along the external surface of the magnetic circuit.

The time evolution of the temperature field \(T\) follows from solution of the heat-transfer equation in the form
$$\mathrm{div} (\lambda \, \mathrm{grad}T) = \rho c_{\mathrm{p}} \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathrm{grad}\,T \right) - p_{\mathrm{J}}\,,$$

where \(\lambda\) stands for the thermal conductivity, \(\rho\) is the specific mass, \(c_{\mathrm{p}}\) represents the specific heat at a constant pressure and \(p_\mathrm{J}\) denotes the internal volumetric losses that transform into heat. In our case these losses are only produced in the rotating billet by the induced currents of density \(\mathbf{J_{\mathrm{ind}}}\). Their value at a given point follows from the formulae.

<h3>Selected results</h3>
<!--
Figure N shows the distribution of magnetic flux density B in the system for the nominal revolutions of the billet (nnom = 1420 rpm). Oversaturated are just very small areas near the corners of joints between the permanent magnets and magnetic circuit.

Analogously, Fig. N show the distribution of volumetric Joule losses pJ produced by the currents induced in the rotating billet (for the same revolutions). In accordance with theory, the highest (both positive and negative) values are generated in the surface layers of the billet.

Fig. 5 compares the calculated and measured curves of the temperature evolution at the same places of the billet (in its center and on its external surface). The measurements were realized on experimental device. It is evident that the agreement is extremely good.
